# Handling Skewed Features and Targets in Regression

## 1. Visualising & Quantifying Skewness

- **Plots**: Histogram (+ KDE), box‑plot, violin, empirical CDF, Q–Q plot.
- **Numeric measure**  
  ```python
  # unbiased (G1) skewness
  target_skew = df['target'].skew(bias=False)
  feature_skew = df['feature1'].skew(bias=False)
  ```
  `pandas.Series.skew(bias=False)` returns the bias‑corrected Fisher–Pearson coefficient $(G_{1}$).  
  For `scipy.stats.skew`, pass `bias=False` for the same estimator.

## 2. Practical Guidelines for Deciding on a Transform

| Absolute skew ($g_1$) | Typical action | Rationale |
|---------------------------|----------------|-----------|
| < 0.5 | Usually leave as‑is | Already close to symmetry; variance‑stabilising transforms rarely change cross‑validation score. |
| 0.5 – < 1.0 | Check residuals & CV | Try both raw and transformed; prefer the version that gives lower error **and** more homoscedastic residuals. |
| ≥ 1.0 | Transform is often helpful | Long right/left tail inflates squared‑error losses and heteroscedasticity; log/Box‑Cox/Yeo‑Johnson usually stabilise variance. |

Always verify with *empirical* cross‑validation rather than fixed thresholds.

### Choosing an evaluation metric

MSE / RMSE overweight extreme errors under heavy skew.  Prefer **MAE**, **Huber**, **quantile loss**, or compute RMSE after a *variance‑stabilising* transform (e.g. RMSLE when all targets > 0).

> **Caveat – RMSLE**  
> Works only for strictly positive targets and still penalises large *multiplicative* errors heavily. Not a general robust loss.

## 3. Model Sensitivity to Skewness

| Model family | Sensitivity to skew in **target** \(y\) | Notes |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------|-------|
| Ordinary least squares / Ridge / Lasso | High (if residuals heteroscedastic) | Linearity & equal‑variance assumptions apply to *residuals*. Skewed *predictors* are OK as long as residuals behave. |
| k‑NN, SVM (ε‑SVR) | Low – Medium | Sensitivity comes from chosen loss (squared, ε‑insensitive, MAE). |
| Neural nets | Medium | Sensitive if loss is squared‑error and no variance stabilisation; robust if using quantile or Huber loss. |
| Huber / quantile regression | Low | Built‑in robust loss. |
| Tree ensembles (RF, XGB, LGBM) | Low | Invariant to strictly **monotonic** transforms of features; default squared‑error loss on a *skewed target* still amplifies tail influence. Switch to Huber/quantile loss or transform *y*. |

## 4. Transforming the **Target** (\(y\))

### When to transform

- Residuals show heteroscedastic “megaphone” pattern.
- $(|g_{1}| ≥ 1)$ and CV error decreases after transform.
- Business metric cares about *relative* rather than absolute error.

### When **not** to transform

- Stakeholders need predictions in natural units and accuracy is acceptable.
- You already use a distribution‑aware model (e.g. Gamma GLM with log link).
- Robust loss (quantile/Huber) achieves desired accuracy.

### Common transforms

| Transform | Works with | `scikit‑learn` helper |
|-----------|------------|-----------------------|
| `log1p`   | positive data, right‑tail | `FunctionTransformer(np.log1p)` |
| **Box‑Cox** | positive data | `PowerTransformer(method="box-cox")` |
| **Yeo–Johnson** | positive & negative | `PowerTransformer(method="yeo-johnson")` |

**Tip:** wrap the whole thing in `TransformedTargetRegressor` to automate forward/backward transforms.  It removes boilerplate but does **not** pick the best λ; tune that with CV.

## 5. Transforming **Features**

### Transform when

- CV shows gain (often when $(|g_{1}| ≥ 1)$).
- The variance increases with the mean (classic log or square‑root fix).

### Avoid transforming when

- Interpretability of coefficients in raw units matters.
- Variable is categorical coded as an integer.
- A later model in the pipeline is rank‑invariant (tree, monotonic GBM).

### Useful transformers

| Purpose | Transformer |
|---------|-------------|
| Strict log / log1p | `FunctionTransformer(np.log1p)` |
| Box‑Cox / Yeo–Johnson | `PowerTransformer` |
| Map to normal / uniform by ranks | `QuantileTransformer` |

Use `ColumnTransformer` to apply transforms selectively.

❓ Is quantile regression preferable to OLS when the target is normally distributed but features are skewed?
Short answer:
No, not necessarily. If your target variable is normally distributed, and your goal is to predict its mean, then OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) regression is still appropriate — even if your features are skewed.

🔍 Why? Let’s break it down:
✅ OLS Assumptions (Key Points):
Linearity: The relationship between predictors and the target is linear.

Independence: Observations are independent.

Homoscedasticity: Constant variance of residuals.

Normality of residuals (not of predictors): For inference (e.g., p-values), not prediction.

No multicollinearity.

⚠️ OLS does not assume predictors (features) are normally distributed.
Skewed predictors can be fine as long as the linearity and homoscedasticity assumptions hold in the residuals.

🧮 When is Quantile Regression Useful?
Quantile regression estimates a specific quantile (e.g., median, 90th percentile) of the target, rather than the mean.

Use it when:

You care about robustness to outliers.

The residuals are heteroscedastic (variance changes with predictor).

You want to understand how predictors affect different parts of the target distribution (e.g., low vs. high-income predictions).

The conditional distribution of the target is skewed or heavy-tailed, even if the marginal distribution is not.

📌 Summary Decision Table:
| Scenario                           | Suggested Model         | Why?                                           |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Target is normal, features skewed  | OLS                     | Features’ distribution doesn’t matter much.    |
| Target is skewed / heteroscedastic | Quantile Regression     | Robust and better for tails/heteroscedasticity |
| Outliers in target or noise        | Quantile (e.g., median) | More robust to outliers                        |
| Interested in tail behavior        | Quantile Regression     | Captures high/low conditional quantiles        |


💡 Practical Tip:
You can use transformations (e.g., log, Box-Cox) on skewed features if:

They violate linearity with the target.

Or they lead to heteroscedastic residuals.

Let me know if you want code examples comparing both approaches or how to check residual assumptions.

What happens if the skew feature is highly correlated to the target and it can help with prediction. However you are interested in the tail end of prediction. Note that target is normally distributed 

ChatGPT said:
This is a subtle and important scenario. Let’s look at the key conditions:

📌 Problem Recap:
✅ Target is normally distributed.

✅ One or more features are skewed.

✅ A skewed feature is highly correlated with the target.

✅ You're interested in tail-end predictions (e.g., top 10%, bottom 10%).

🔍 Implications:
1. OLS Might Not Be Ideal for Tail-End Predictions
OLS minimizes the mean squared error and gives you the best linear unbiased estimate of the conditional mean. It’s not optimized for performance in the tails of the distribution.

So even though the target is normal overall, OLS is still biased toward central predictions, which is not helpful if you care about extremes.


2. Quantile Regression Can Help
Even with a normally distributed target, conditional distributions (target given predictors) may become asymmetric or heteroscedastic, especially when predictors are skewed and highly predictive.

Quantile regression lets you model:
90th percentile: $Q_{0.9}(Y|X)$
10th percentile: $Q_{0.1}(Y|X)$

This helps directly target the tails, rather than the mean.

3. Skewed Predictors Are Not a Problem Per Se
A skewed feature that’s highly correlated with the target is valuable — don’t transform it blindly. Instead:

Check if it leads to nonlinear or heteroscedastic relationships in the residuals.

Consider keeping the skew and using quantile regression if you care about prediction in the tails.

| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Predict mean accurately           | OLS                                     | Simple and efficient                  |
| Predict high-risk / extreme cases | Quantile Regression                     | Directly models upper/lower quantiles |
| Predict conditional variance      | Quantile Regression + Variance Modeling | For heteroscedasticity                |
| Feature highly skewed & nonlinear | Add transformations or splines          | Improve fit for nonlinear patterns    |


💡 Pro Tip:
If the skewed feature has nonlinear influence, consider:

Quantile regression + splines or interactions

Or even gradient boosting or random forests with quantile output (e.g., LightGBM with quantile objective)

🧠 Part 1: What is Quantile Regression?
🎯 Goal:
While linear regression predicts the mean of y given x, quantile regression predicts a specific quantile — like the median (50th percentile), 90th percentile, or 10th percentile.

This is useful when:

- You care about how the extremes behave (e.g., worst-case or best-case scenarios).

- The spread of y is not constant (heteroscedasticity).

- You're building robust models less sensitive to outliers.

📈 Analogy:
Imagine you're trying to estimate house prices.

- Linear regression gives you the average price.

- Quantile regression lets you ask:

  - "What’s the price at the 90th percentile?" (luxury homes)

  - "What’s the price at the 10th percentile?" (budget homes)

🔧 Quantile Loss Function (Pinball Loss)
For a quantile $\tau$ (e.g., $\tau = 0.9$ for the 90th percentile), we define the pinball loss:

$$\text{Loss}_{\tau}(y, \hat{y}) = \begin{cases} \tau \cdot (y - \hat{y}) \text{ if } y \geq \hat{y}\\  (1 - \tau) \cdot (\hat{y} - y) \text{ if } y \lt \hat{y} \end{cases}  $$

This asymmetric loss penalizes underestimates and overestimates differently, depending on the quantile $\tau$

- For $\tau = 0.5$ it becomes the absolute error (median regression).

📊 Performance Metric: Mean Pinball Loss
After training, we evaluate how well the model estimates a quantile using the average pinball loss over all predictions.

Lower pinball loss → better quantile prediction.

🧠 Part 2: What is Huber Regression?
🎯 Goal:
Huber regression is a robust version of linear regression. It combines the strengths of:

Mean squared error (MSE) — sensitive to small errors.

Mean absolute error (MAE) — robust to outliers.

📈 Analogy:
Suppose you’re grading students, and most scores are near 75. One student scores 10 due to a fluke.

MSE: that outlier heavily influences the average.

MAE: treats all errors equally, but is not smooth for optimization.

Huber: ignores extreme outliers, but remains smooth — the best of both worlds.

🔧 Huber Loss Function:
$$\text{Loss}_{\delta}(y, \hat{y}) = \begin{cases} \frac{1}{2} \cdot (y - \hat{y})^2 \text{ if } | y - \hat{y} | \leq \delta\\  \delta \cdot (|y - \hat{y}| - \frac{1}{2} \delta) \text{ otherwise }  \end{cases}  $$

Where 
$\delta$ is a tuning parameter:

- Small errors → like MSE.

- Large errors → like MAE.

📊 Performance Metrics:
Mean Huber Loss — average of the Huber loss over all predictions.

RMSE or MAE may still be reported to compare with standard models.
